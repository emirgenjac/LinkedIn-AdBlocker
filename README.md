# LinkedIn-AdBlocker
Being annoyed by ads constantly popping up on my feed as I scroll through LinkedIn, I decided to try building an ad blocker. It took a lot of troubleshooting but I got there eventually.

The script itself is simple, it finds all of the ads through LinkedIn's "Promoted" label on each ad, and then finds the parent nodes and removes them.
